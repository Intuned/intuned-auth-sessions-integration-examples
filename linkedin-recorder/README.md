# Linkedin automation using Intuned recorder-based auth session 

simple project that showcase how to use Intuned recorder-based auth session to collect access to users linkedin accounts and automate actions on behalf of them.


## Getting started

before getting started you need access to intuned platform. [contact us](https://docs.intunedhq.com/docs/support/contact-us) if you do not have access.  

1. follow steps [here](https://github.com/Intuned/intuned-auth-sessions-integration-examples/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) to clone the repo and install dependencies.
2. follow the following guide to create your intuned project [How to automate linkedin](https://docs.intunedhq.com/docs/guides/auth/how-to-automate-linkedin).
3. setup your `.env` file with the following environment variables:
    1.  `DATABASE_URL`: project uses postgress to store users and connections. you can use any postgress database. the project includes a `docker-compose.yml` file to start a postgress container.
    2.  `INTUNED_API_KEY`: [How to create API keys?](https://docs.intunedhq.com/docs/guides/platform/how-to-create-api-keys)
    3.  `INTUNED_WORKSPACE_ID`: [How to get a workspace ID?](https://docs.intunedhq.com/docs/guides/platform/how-to-get-a-workspace-id)
    4.  `INTUNED_PROJECT_NAME`: [How to get a project name?](https://docs.intunedhq.com/docs/guides/platform/how-to-get-project-name)
    5.  `AUTH_SECRET`: random string.

4. run the project:
```bash
yarn dev
```


# Details

1. Using Intuned's client sdk to interact with the platform.

```ts
import { IntunedClient } from "@intuned/client";

export function getIntunedClient() {
  return new IntunedClient({
    apiKey: process.env.INTUNED_API_KEY as string,
    workspaceId: process.env.INTUNED_WORKSPACE_ID as string,
  });
}
```

2. generate a recorder-based auth session for the user.

```ts
const client = getIntunedClient();
const result = await client.project.authSessions.recorder.start(INTUNED_PROJECT_NAME, {
  authSessionId: id,
});
```

3. open the recorder url in a browser and let the user interact with linkedin in order to record their actions, and listen for intuned events to know when the session is finished or failed.

```ts
window.open(recorderUrl, "newWindow", "height=600,width=800");

const handleMessage = async (event: MessageEvent) => {
    if (event.data.type == "RECORDER_SESSION_FINISHED_SUCCESSFULLY") {
    toast("Session finished successfully");
    router.refresh();
    return;
    }

    if (event.data.type == "RECORDER_SESSION_FAILED") {
    toast("Session recording failed");
    return;
    }
};

window.addEventListener("message", handleMessage);
```

4. use the auth session id to automate linkedin actions afterwards. you can use sync or async calls to run your actions. learn more about [run apis](https://docs.intunedhq.com/client-apis/api-reference/run-overview).

```ts
  const linkedinConnection = await getUserLinkedinConnection();
  ...
  const client = getIntunedClient();
  const result = await client.project.run.sync(INTUNED_PROJECT_NAME, {
    api: "like-post",
    parameters: {
      url,
    },
    authSession: {
      id: linkedinConnection.intuned_auth_session_id,
    },
    retry: {
      maximumAttempts: 2,
    },
  });

```

5. you can check the status of the auth session later to ask the user to reconnect.

```ts
  const intunedClient = getIntunedClient();
  const intunedAuthSession = await intunedClient.project.authSessions.one(
    INTUNED_PROJECT_NAME,
    linkedinConnection.intuned_auth_session_id
  );
  const status = intunedAuthSession.status;
  if (status === "EXPIRED") {
    // ask the user to reconnect
  }
```
